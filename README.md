# git and GitHub

# It's easier to make your repository on GitHub and then clone it to your local machine
# Basic steps when ready to commit
#    - `git status`
#    - determine which files you want to commit
#    - `git add` the files you want to commit
#        * `git add -p` for committing in chunks
#    - `git commit` your staged files
#    - `git push` your changes to the remote repository!
