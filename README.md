## git and GitHub

It's easier to make your repository on GitHub and then clone it to your local machine
Basic steps when ready to commit
    1. `git status`
    1. determine which files you want to commit
    1. `git add` the files you want to commit
        * `git add -p` for committing in chunks
    1. `git commit` your staged files
    1. `git push` your changes to the remote repository!
