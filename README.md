It's easier to make your repository on GitHub and then clone it to your local machine
Basic steps when ready to commit
    l. `git status`
    l. determine which files you want to commit
    l. `git add` the files you want to commit
        * `git add -p` for committing in chunks
    l. `git commit` your staged files
    l. `git push` your changes to the remote repository!
