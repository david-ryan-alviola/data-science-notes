## git and GitHub

1. It's easier to make your repository on GitHub and then clone it to your local machine
2. Basic steps when ready to commit
* `git status`
* determine which files you want to commit
* `git add` the files you want to commit or `git add -p` for committing in chunks
* `git commit` your staged files
* `git push` your changes to the remote repository!
