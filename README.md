## Python

* Environment setup
    * can use zsh if you export to a .zsh_profile instead of .bash_profile
    * `echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/anaconda3/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zsh_profile`
* Jupyter Notebook
    * Similar to Kaggle
    1. Shift + Enter runs a selected cell
    2. Escape puts you into command mode
    3. Enter highlights the select cell and enters edit mode
    4. Can export notebooks as html files to view as notes (not executable code)
