## git and GitHub

* It's easier to make your repository on GitHub and than clone it to your local machine.
* Basic steps when ready to commit
    1. Run `git status` to see which files have changes.
    2. Determine which files you want to commit.
    3. `git add` the files you want to commit or `git add -p` for committing in chunks.
    4. `git commit` your staged files.
    5. `git push` your changes to the remote repository!
